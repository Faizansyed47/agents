Multi AI Agent System

Functions are provided in combined files for ease of understanding. Functions can be isolated based on Agent architecture and project structure for use. 


1. Unique-records script allows you to save unique records from millions of records across a number of files. Based on the application architecture and project structure, it can be broken down into different files to support multi-agent functionality. 
2. Excel to Csv converter converts xlsx files to csv for better processing. 
3. Vector-embeddings.py file has all the necessary necessary steps that you need to take to convert data into embeddings (Vectors, Dens & sparse dimensions) and store in a vector store such as Milvus so that a hybrid semantic search can be performed.
