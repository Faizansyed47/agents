## Why an SDK

An SDK makes your agentic AI logic reusable:

- Agents, tools, and workflows are shared across projects.
- Microservices can import the SDK without copying code.
- Easy to extend with new tools or agents.
- Keeps project structure clean and maintainable.

---

## Project Setup

1. Create a new folder for your SDK:

```bash
mkdir my_sdk && cd my_sdk
```

2. Create the package structure:

```bash
mkdir -p my_sdk/{agents,tools,models,vectorstores,workflows,utils}
touch my_sdk/__init__.py
mkdir examples tests docs
```

---

## Organize Code

3. Identify reusable pieces: agents, tools, model adapters, embeddings, vector stores, utilities.

4. Move logic into modules:

- `agents/base.py`, `agents/<agent_types>.py`  
- `tools/<tool_name>.py`  
- `models/embeddings.py`, `models/llm_adapter.py`  
- `vectorstores/<store>.py`  
- `utils/*.py`

5. Remove any code that runs on import (network calls, long tasks).

6. Wrap scripts as classes or functions:

```python
class Scraper:
    def crawl(self, url):
        ...
```

---

## Define the Public API

7. Decide which classes/functions should be public (e.g., `Agent`, `Embedder`, `VectorStore`).

8. Expose them in `my_sdk/__init__.py`:

```python
from .agents.base import Agent
from .models.embeddings import Embedder
from .vectorstores.milvus import VectorStore

__all__ = ["Agent", "Embedder", "VectorStore"]
```

9. Keep helper functions and internal modules private (prefix with `_`).

---

## Configuration and Dependencies

10. Avoid hardcoding values. Use constructor arguments, config objects, or environment variables.

11. Declare dependencies in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-sdk"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = ["requests", "pydantic"]
```

12. Optional dependencies can be installed via extras:

```bash
pip install my-sdk[playwright]
```

---

## Examples and Documentation

13. Include a short quick-start example in the README:

```python
from my_sdk import ReactiveAgent, SearchTool

agent = ReactiveAgent(tools=[SearchTool()])
print(agent.run("Find AI trends."))
```

14. Add runnable examples in `examples/`:

- `example_run_agent.py`  
- `example_ingest.py`  

15. Add docstrings to all public classes and methods.

---

## Testing

16. Add unit and integration tests in `tests/` (mock network or model calls if needed).  
17. Use linters and type checks (`pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`) in your CI pipeline.

---

## Packaging and Publishing

1. Install build tools if you don’t have them:

```bash
pip install build wheel twine
```

2. Build your SDK into a wheel:

```bash
python -m build
```

This generates a `dist/` folder containing:

- `my_sdk-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel file)
- `my_sdk-0.1.0.tar.gz` (source archive)

3. Install the wheel locally to test:

```bash
pip install dist/my_sdk-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

4. Publish to PyPI:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

5. Install from PyPI in another project:

```bash
pip install my-sdk
```

---

## Using the SDK in Microservices

21. Keep SDK logic in the package; microservices handle orchestration.

22. Example usage in a microservice:

```python
from my_sdk import Agent

agent = Agent("research")
result = agent.run("Summarize trending AI news")
```

23. Provide async and sync versions of functions if necessary.

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Package exposes core API through `__init__.py`  
- [ ] No side-effects on import  
- [ ] Examples work after `pip install .`  
- [ ] Tests pass in CI  
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` is configured  
- [ ] Optional dependencies declared  
- [ ] Microservice examples ready  

---

Follow these steps and your Python agentic AI project will be a reusable, well-structured SDK ready for PyPI and microservices.
